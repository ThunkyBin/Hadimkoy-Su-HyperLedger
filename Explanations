Hadımköy Juice Factory Supply Chain Application
This project uses Hyperledger Fabric to provide supply chain traceability for a juice factory in Hadımköy, Istanbul.

Purpose

Track juice products throughout the production process, from raw materials receipt to final delivery.

Key benefits:

Detect expiring products

Manage inventory levels

Provide traceability from production to consumer
Technologies

Hyperledger Fabric - The permissioned distributed ledger for the application data
Python SDK - Used to connect to and interact with the Fabric network
Docker - Used for deploying and running the Fabric network components

Features

Connects to a multi-organization Hyperledger Fabric network
Listens for chaincode events when new juices are created
Stores product details like flavor, batch number and barcode on the ledger
Tracks product locations within the factory as they move through receiving, processing, filling and storage areas
Allows querying products by attributes like flavor and expiration date
Emits events when product statuses change (in transit, delivered, etc.)

Running the app
Start the Fabric network using docker-compose
Run the hadimkoysu.py file to interact with the network
Follow the logs to see products being created, locations updated and events emitted
